- Red spruce study system and exome capture file
- Structure of fastq file (DNA sequnces, plus the Qscores)
- Using program FastQC, analyzed the sequncing run for one file


* [Entry 2: 2023-09-13](#id-section2)

- FastQC results discussion, good qulaity sequence data for most reads
- Initial 5 bp or so had more variable base frequncies, The very end of reads had slightly lower @-score
- Based on this we set up an analysis to trim the reads, using 'fastq' program
- bash script run  'fast.sh'
